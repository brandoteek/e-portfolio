										<h2>INDIVIDUAL REFLECTIVE </h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										</br>Introduction</br>

The current reﬂective essay follows Gibbs reﬂective cycle (University of Edinburgh, 2024). The essay is divided in several sections to point out the experience obtained from the Secure Software Development module.</br>

</br>Description</br>

Initially the module challenges us with the creation of a design of a Music application that can perform Create, Update, Read, Delete operations (CRUD).</br>

While interacting with my peers, everyone came with diKerent level of knowledge regarding software engineering and databases.</br>

The design phase oKers us an opportunity to contribute in the diKerent parts of the project, like the UML diagrams, Database design relationships, and the inter-relationship between these diagrams and components.</br>

Due to time zones of several of us in the team, it was not simple to agree in speciﬁc meetings. Therefore, the use of communication tools like WhatsApp and specially MS Teams provided by the University was quite useful for the coordination.</br>

The biggest challenge came with the Individual coding activity, since myself I have a background in network engineering, it has been one of the most challenging responsibilities due to my limited language programming experience.</br>

</br>Feelings</br>

I could notice that everyone in the Team wanted to contribute, even myself although my programming level. In the design phase everyone shared their part, and I was proud to share time and energy with a motivated team.</br>

However, I struggled to connect properly the elements from the design into real programming language, like Python.</br>

I never felt in control while programming the design. Plenty of frustration happened but I tried as much as I could to provide something.</br>

Procrastination sabotaged my progress several times. I experienced that with programming, but to be fair I tried to overcome that feeling and only through practicing little by little I could see that I started to understand progressively. Little victories that feel a diKerence at long term. I am trying to improve my patience level while learning programming by continuously having this in mind.</br>

I am aware that without trying is impossible to improve, so I nowadays I spend hours trying to comprehend a piece of code. I found it admirable that some people can understand the complexities of translating an idea, an algorithm into a computer language, but I understand that some of them had to overcome their own procrastination issues and took action to obtain the level in programming they have today.</br>

</br>Evaluation</br>

While working collaboratively, we have respect to each other but at the same time we were not directly confrontative in points that could be improve our design. We tend to avoid “hurting” any feeling or “judgement” to avoid, also disagreements. This could have limited our ﬁnal design and diagrams. However, while working in a team it’s possible to see oneself weakness and areas for improvement, due to the group questions and liabilities.</br>

It was challenging to implement and comprehend the interaction between the artifacts in Python language. It demanded Object Oriented Programming knowledge and information correlation.</br>

</br>Analysis</br>

Teamwork is not simple when everyone has an opinion and perspective. However, my team was professional and respectful. Everyone listens to every idea and opinion, which made it comfortable and not tedious.

Additionally, regarding the module, it was interesting to get familiarized with OWASP, software development practices, and learn about automated security tools like Pylint and security testing tool like Bandit. To refactor and reﬂect about the written code and have a deeper understanding of the created script.</br>

</br>Conclusion</br>

Even though, I recognize my diKiculties to interact with a programming language, I started with baby steps, repeating same lines of codes until is necessary, and in this resubmission even though is not the advanced level I would like to provide. Personally, I felt that the perseverance paid oK. I felt more conﬁdent while using functions, operators, iterations, although there is still plenty to learn and absorb. Action Plan</br>

I decided to perfectionate my Python skills and taking it to the next level but continue practicing time to time, like a normal habit, part of the daily habits. As every skill, is the only way to achieve the desired level.</br>

Learn more about Object Oriented Programming languages with Python and tools like GitHub.</br>

Understand by practicing how to implement more eKectively secure software development practices by using security tools like Pylint and Bandit in future programming activities.</br>

Dedicate speciﬁc periods of time to studying software development in the ﬁeld of cybersecurity.</br>

I am looking forward to including in my Master Thesis, Python programming to provide forecasts or automate security process. The advantages of including software development into the cybersecurity ﬁeld will be quite rewarding.</br>
